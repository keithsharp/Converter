Converter is a simple Cocoa application that uses the PROJ.4 library to
convert from a WGS84 latitude and longitude to OSGB eastings and northings.
I wrote this application as an experiment in using third party libraries in
Objective-C/Xcode applications.

For a full explanation see my blog:

The code is in the public domain - do what you want with it!
